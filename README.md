# Ironhack bootcamp project 1 (Module 1)

## Goals (official):
Browser based game, using HTML, CSS, JS, DOM manipulation, OOP
- Render a game in the browser.
- Have logic for winning and/or losing and show feedback to the player in either case:
- Your game must have logic that allows the player to win or lose.
- Your game code must be organized in separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Use plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
- Your game entities and elements must be organized using classes and OOP.
- Have a repo on GitHub.
- Have at least one (1) commit per day that you worked on.
- You must deploy your game online using GitHub Pages so anyone can play it.

## Personal goals:
- Get first experience with Typescript
- Get first experience with Jest (testing)

## To get "excellent" grade:
- Aditional features like high score tracking, level progression
- Unit tests/ Typescript/ private class fields
- Modular code with clear responsibilities and minimal coupling
- The code is exceptionally well-formatted, with clear and descriptive variable and function names that convey purpose and usage. The code is easy to read and understand, with an exemplary level of clarity
- Extra features like CSS animations and transitions. Highly polished UI
- Regular commits with clear messages
- Deployed game is full functional with no errors preset

## Game idea: basic infinite side scroller
- Fallback in case parallax gets too tricky (with dom objects): very polished snake:)

## Rough time layout (27.10.23 - 02.11.23):
- Fri: working draft 
definition of done: oop code layout, start- & game- & endScreen, player can be moved
nice to have: tests

- Mon: polish basic version
definition of done: obstacles, tests, graphics, high score 
nice to have: shooting

- Tue: Parallax effect background
definition of done: infinitely moving background
nice to have: foreground objects which are "in front of" the player

- Wed: Addons
definition of done: to be decided
nice to have: 
    - onscreen buttons (player can click on them instead of using the keyboard)
    - music
    - sound effetcts
    - scallale / multiple sizes UI
    - sprite animation

- Thu: Buffer, if anything goes wrong
definition of done: working project which can be presented
nice to have: 
    - refactor code
    - understand how typescript affected the project, if used correctly, what to learn for future
